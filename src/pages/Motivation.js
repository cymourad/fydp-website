				As technologies continue to evolve in automating tasks that are
				routinely performed by humans, the workforce of the 21<sup>st</sup>{" "}
				century will increasingly spend more time seated at desks behind a
				screen. The adverse effect of this transition, however, is the basic
				health of human bodies being neglected due to the lack of exercise and
				poor health choices of a consistent sedentary lifestyle. Moreover, the
				lack of training in good ergonomic practices coupled with long hours of
				sitting with bad posture can lead to many issues such as back, neck, and
				shoulder pain, poor circulation, impaired lung function, poor digestion,
				misaligned spine, curvature of the spine, headache and jaw pain. In
				fact, ever since the COVID-19 pandemic started, 40% of adults (aged
				18-64) reported having to work from home. This, in turn, resulted in
				many former office desk workers losing access to their posture
				equipment, which in itself aided them in enforcing ergonomic posture in
				their workplace.

				Many posture experts explain that good posture is rooted in good habits.
				Those good habits, however, are substantially reliant on both a person’s
				muscle capacity, and their ability in maintaining these habits in a
				consistent manner. The upper, and especially the lower back, muscles
				play a significant role in sustaining a person’s posture. But once these
				muscles grow tired in sustaining the person in the same position, the
				muscles begin adjusting into a bad posture position for the sake of
				comfort. Thus, many experts explain that the solution to bad posture is
				to consistently train those muscle groups into becoming stronger
				supports, and in turn be able to maintain good posture for longer
				periods of time. By consistently training those muscle groups for longer
				periods of time, the idea is that a user’s ideal position for good
				posture would eventually be ingrained into their muscle memory with no
				further effort for correction. However, most people don’t consistently
				train their body in that manner, especially with society’s increasingly
				work centric lifestyle. Therefore, simply learning to be more aware of
				one’s posture can only be so helpful. The focus of posture correction
				systems must adjust their approach, and this is what this project
				attempts to do.

			<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", width: "80%", margin: "auto" }}>
				Most solutions in today’s market are short-term in nature, where they
				depend on a buzzing mechanism to alert the user to straighten their
				posture immediately, or they rely too heavily on the user's
				self-discipline such that the solutions prescribe exercises to
				strengthen their support muscles. The problem with the first class is
				the fact that they are short-term solutions to a long-term problem.
				After some period of time, the undisciplined nature of most users to
				maintain their suggested posture will kick in, and the muscles that
				cannot sustain the unfamiliar weight for long periods of time will
				eventually succumb. Thus, even if a user responds to the buzzer’s prompt
				to correct their posture, they are likely to return to their bad posture
				shortly thereafter, since their support muscles are tired. Now, this
				might suggest that the second class of solutions is likely to be more
				beneficial. It essentially consists of both engineered equipment (e.g.,
				wearable bracelet) and specially designed exercises, both of which are
				designed to train muscles into becoming stronger, conforming to good
				posture position, and embedding the posture into muscle memory. Despite
				the promise in these solutions, however, its success relies heavily on
				the user’s discipline, motivation, and self-paced schedule. Hence, many
				users end up quitting their program of exercises, and subsequently
				neglect their wearable device’s usefulness.

				Therefore, there exists a prominent need for a system that can help desk
				workers build and maintain good long-term posture habits, while fully
				occupied with their sedentary job. Moreover, there is an important need
				for a system that can help guide a user toward an ideal position,
				customized for them individually.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", width: "80%", margin: "auto" }}>
				By considering the details of the previously outlined needs assessment,
				it can be devised that the goal or objective of this project is to fully
				design a detailed system that can reliably promote a good sitting
				posture model. Furthermore, the objective is to develop a system model
				that can be customized to each home-office desk-job worker, such that it
				can help them prevent future chronic bodily pain that is mainly due to
				one sitting with bad posture for long periods of time.
